# Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of building a sentiment analysis system for product reviews. The dataset used contains 100,000 instances of reviews with various sentiments. We begin by preprocessing the data, including cleaning the text and mapping sentiments based on ratings. A sentiment analysis model is trained using logistic regression. Next, we create a user-friendly web API using Django, allowing users to input reviews and ratings for product sentiment prediction. The API employs the trained model to classify sentiment and provides real-time feedback. The entire project is containerized using Docker and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Fargate. A continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is set up with GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring seamless project management.
